<h1>Using GW ScholarSpace to comply with GW's Open Access policy</h1>
<p>The Open Access Policy automatically gives GW a non-exclusive right to distribute the works, unless an opt-out waiver has been signed (see <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/about/open-access-faqs#Opting%20Out">Opting Out</a>). When signing publishing agreements for the publication of an article, the author(s) should let the publisher know that the agreement is subject to prior license agreement with The George Washington University. The <a href="https://library.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/communications/AuthorsAddendum17Dec2014.pdf">Author's Addendum</a> can be found at <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/about/open-access-at-gw/">Open Access at GW</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as an article is published, you will be able to upload a copy directly into the GW ScholarSpace repository. Currently, you may submit your work through our Deposit Form and the Library will notify you when the work has been uploaded.</p>
<h1>Depositing your works</h1>
<h4>Where do I go to deposit my works to GW ScholarSpace?</h4>
<p>To deposit your works, please use the <a href="https://library.gwu.edu/scholarspace/submit/">GW ScholarSpace Deposit Form</a>.</p>
<h4>What is the maximum size of files that can be uploaded to GW ScholarSpace?</h4>
<p>GW ScholarSpace has an upload size limit of 25 MB. If you would like to upload multiple files or a file larger than 25 MB, please send an email to scholarspace@gwu.edu.</p>
<h4>Do I need to fill in all of the fields on the deposit form when submitting my work?</h4>
<p>You, or a designated depositor, will need to fill in the required fields on the deposit form and accept the Deposit Agreement before being able to submit your work; however, if you can provide more information about your work in the optional fields provided, it will increase the discoverability of your work within GW ScholarSpace.</p>
<h1>Visibility and Sharing</h1>
<p>Works deposited to GW ScholarSpace are publicly discoverable except where embargoed.</p>
<h1 id="embargoes">Embargoes</h1>
<p>Works deposited to GW ScholarSpace may be embargoed for a limited period if required by the publisher (see <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/about/faculty-open-access">Open Access Policy</a>).</p>
<h1>Preservation</h1>
<p>GW ScholarSpace is committed to providing long-term access to all works submitted to GW ScholarSpace. Adhering to best practices, GW ScholarSpace and GW Libraries staff use digital preservation strategies that adapt to the changing technological environment.</p>
<p>All work submitted to GW ScholarSpace will be preserved at a basic bit-level. The characteristics of a work (such as format, mime type, date created) will be captured and stored as metadata during the deposit process to mitigate potential format obsolescence. All works deposited will receive a SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) checksum, which is used to document file integrity over time. Regular file integrity checks will be performed to check for changes (such as file corruption), and can even be scheduled on-demand.</p>
<p>Certain file formats (such as openly-documented, non-proprietary, lossless) are more easily preserved than others. To better assist contributors, please refer to the table below which details recommended preservation file formats.</p>
<h4 id="preservation-formats">What are recommended preservation formats?</h4>
<p>Recommended preservation formats have been accepted by information technology, archival, and records management professional communities due to multiple factors such as: format longevity, acceptance and use in professional communities, long term accessibility of most viewing software, and incorporated metadata. For more information about digital preservation best practices and standards, please see the Library of Congress <a href="http://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/TOC.html">Recommended Formats Statement.</a></p>
